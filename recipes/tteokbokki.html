        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong><em>Sweet and spicy</em></strong> recipe for one of my favorite south korean dishes.</p>
        <p>Very <em>easy</em> to <em>make at home</em>, and it doesn't take a lot of time to do.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em>1 kg</em> | Tteokbokki</li>
            <li><em>2</em>    | Eggs (2 p/person)</li>
            <li><em>2</em>    | Fish balls (2 p/person)</li>
            <li><strong>Sauce</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>3 tbsp</em> | Gochujang</li>
                <li><em>3 tbsp</em> | Sugar</li>
                <li><em>2 tbsp</em> | Soy sauce</li>
                <li><em>3 tbsp</em> | Agave</li>
                <li><em>4 tbsp</em> | Ketchup</li>
                <li><em>2 tbsp</em> | Honey</li>
                <li><em>50 g</em>   | Minced garlic</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the <em>fish balls</em> around 10 minutes, or when they begin to float. Don't forget two fish balls per person being served;</li>
            <li>Boil the <em>eggs</em> around 10 minutes. Don't forget two eggs per person being served;</li>
            <li><em>while the fish balls and the eggs are boiling, prepare the sauce:</em></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Get a bowl;</li>
                <li>Put inside the bowl all the sauce ingredients, in no particular order;</li>
                <li>Mix everything with a spoon until it looks uniform;</li>
                <li><em>in this part, you can add portions as you see fit.</em></li>
            </ol>
            <li>Get a big pan and add the sauce you just made, and start boiling it;</li>
            <li>When you see the sauce bubbling, you can add a little bit of water (2 cups) and wait for it to bubble again;</li>
            <li>Insert the Tteokbokki into the pan;</li>
            <li>Add water as you see fit, whilst mixing everything, making sure you cover all the tteokbokki with the sauce;</li>
            <li>Boil the tteokbokki until it's very soft (like a pillow);</li>
            <li>Add the fish balls and the eggs to the pan and mix everything again, also add water as you see fit;</li>
            <li>Boil until the sauce is to your liking, mine is about when its consistency is similar to a yogurt;</li>
            <li>And that's it, you did it! When serving I like to put grated cheese on top, but you don't need to. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

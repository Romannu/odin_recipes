# odin_recipes

BEFORE

* This project will make a recipes page in html.
* It won't have css, but it will help me showcase skills I have learnt until now in html, as well as familiarizing myself more with git commands in bash.
* At the end of this project I'll want to have achieved it with little help as possible, and be more comfortable with git commands.
